Here I will upload projects with proof of my software skills within Excel, MySQL, PowerBI and Tableau.

As someone whose previous industry area is now redundant, I am searching for an opportunity to move into a new long term career in Data Analysis after recently completing a Data Analyst bootcamp course. I am eager to improve on my skillset dependant on the requirements and business goals of a prospective employer as a strong independant learner.

I have experience within Data Cleansing for HSBC and consolidating multiple databases to investigate the final resolution to PPI claims following semi-strict guidelines. Giving benefit of the doubt to the customer if there is any possibility that the data may be inaccurate.

I also have experience Auditing others and giving constructive feedback along with a realistic plan of action for improvement.
